# YAG-Leaderboard
This leaderboard is a series of custom commands for the [YAGPDB bot](https://yagpdb.xyz/). It was developed for the [Rocket Raiders Discord server](https://discord.gg/WsrJUcNETG), that hosts Pokémon GO remote raids across the world. We wanted to have a way to track and display when a host has members that receive hundo, shiny or shundo Pokémon, following a raid.

This was developed for the specific use of our server and relies on some of the details of how our channels are structured and specific emojis/images that we use. There are elements that you will need to set up, specific for your server. I have tried to keep these at the top to make it easier.

## How to use these files
You will need to have some understanding of YAG's Custom Commands feature in the Control Panel. If you are not familiar, it will be helpful to read about it [here](https://docs.yagpdb.xyz/commands/custom-commands).

Each .yag file in the repository is an individual custom command. You will need to copy/past the code of each file into the "response" section of the custom command. You will need to set the correct trigger for it to function correctly.

## Use at your own risk!
Full disclosure: this is my first significant project, diving into custom commands and using YAG's templating language. While it has been tested and seems to work fine, it comes with no guarantee that it will work perfectly for you.

If you are a serious YAG coder, be gentle with me—I am just learning! Seriously, I would be interested in learning better ways of doing things so feel free to leave me a comment or pull-request.
